## Name
Oregon State Recreation Database - A project for CS340 at OSU.

Sam Parkman, Rob MacFarlane

## Description
The Oregon State Recreation database website is a portfolio project that is used to showcase the skills of students that were learned during CS340 at Oregon State. Specifically, the website allows for users to track customers, reservations, activites, and equipment for a recreation center. This is done with a React front end and a express.js and mySQL server side.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
npm install needs to be run first then to install all of the items from package.json. Then pick one of the two methods below.

1. Change directory to the server folder located in the root of the oregonstate_rec_db folder. Then simply type "npm start" and press enter to run. This will also need to be done in the client folder. This will run the website on the PORT that is specified in the .env file. 
2. To run using Forever, move into the server folder again and type 'forever start -c "npm start" ./'. This same process shall be completed in the client folder  

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.
